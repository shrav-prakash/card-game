# Card Game

A simple game of 3-card poker, which is played against the dealer
The dealer deals 3 cards each to both himself and the player one by one, and both the hands are compared in order to find the winner
Rankings are as follows : Straight Flush > Three of a Kind > Straight > Flush > Pair > High Card
Tiebreakers between the same rank are handled by comparing the highest card, and in applicable cases the preceeding cards as well

This is a small project written by me as a way for me to learn GoLang and familiarize myself with its syntax and different functionalities
